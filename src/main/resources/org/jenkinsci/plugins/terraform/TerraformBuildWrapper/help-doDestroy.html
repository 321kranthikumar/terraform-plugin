<p style="font-weight: bold;">Only use this option if you are sure you want to destroy infrastructure that you have created with Terraform</p>
<p>This feature is desirable if you are setting up temporary development, testing/qa environments. Once the build is finished, if this option is selected, all infrastructure stored in the .tfstate will be destroyed.</p>
