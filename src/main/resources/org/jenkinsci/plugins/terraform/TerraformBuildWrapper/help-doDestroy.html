<p style="font-weight: bold;">Only use this option if you are sure you want to destroy infrastructure that you have created with Terraform</p>
<p>This feature is desirable if you are setting up temporary development, testing/qa environments.</p>
<p>Once the build is complete, if this option is selected, all infrastructure stored in the tfstate will be destroyed.</p>
<p>For more information, see: <a href="https://terraform.io/intro/getting-started/destroy.html">Destroy Infrastructure</a>.</p>
